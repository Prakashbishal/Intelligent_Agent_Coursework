Where to Improve 


1. predict_cost – better cost model
Right now: constant 1000 for every trade.

We can:
Use port distances (if accessible from the trade or via the environment).
Use vessel speed and consumption to estimate fuel.
Add port handling costs.
Include idle time as cost (if a schedule leads to a lot of waiting).

2. bid_amount in inform – add profit strategy
Currently:
bid_amount = cost

Later:
Add a profit margin, e.g. cost * 1.2.
Use a dynamic margin: smaller when competition is tough, larger for risky or long-distance routes.
Possibly adjust based on how busy your fleet is (if idle, accept lower margins; if busy, demand higher).

3. _plan_for_trade – smarter vessel selection
Right now, you simply take the first vessel that yields a feasible schedule.

Later:
Evaluate several feasible vessels and pick the cheapest schedule (based on predict_cost).
Prefer vessels that are geographically closer to origin to reduce deadheading.
Avoid leaving some vessels completely idle if that hurts revenue.

4. Use _future_trades in pre_inform
Currently you store future trades but ignore them.

Later:
Use that info to avoid filling your schedule with low-profit trades if a bigger trade is coming soon.
Implement a basic lookahead strategy: “accept this trade only if it doesn’t block me from a potentially more 
profitable future trade.”


5. Use auction_ledger in receive for competitor modelling
Right now you ignore auction_ledger.

Later:
Look through the ledger to see:
What other companies bid.
Which bids won.
What typical margins competitors use.
Estimate competitor profit factors over time.
Adapt your bidding strategy to undercut them slightly when it’s worth it.
